# Active Context: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 2 - Robustness Improvements)

## Current Focus

*   **Phase 2: Robustness Improvements.** Enhancing the server's error handling and potentially adding more specific input validation.

## Recent Changes

*   **Completed Phase 1 (Connection Verification).**
*   **Scaffolded MCP Server & Dependencies.**
*   **Implemented Basic Connection & Credential Refactoring.**
*   **Implemented Core Tools:** `query`, `select`, `create`, `update`, `delete` tools implemented and tested. Confirmed need for `RecordId` instance for specific record operations in `select`, `update`, `delete`.
*   **Implemented Additional Tools:** `merge`, `patch`, `upsert`, `insert`, `insertRelation` tools implemented and tested. Confirmed need for `RecordId` for `merge`, `patch`, `upsert`. Corrected `insertRelation` implementation based on documentation.
*   **Improved Error Logging:** Updated `catch` blocks in all tool handlers to log the full error object (`console.error(..., e)`) instead of just the message, providing more detailed debugging information. Tested error reporting with invalid query syntax.
*   **Updated Memory Bank:** `progress.md` updated to reflect tool completion.

## Next Steps

1.  **Improve Input Validation:** Add more specific checks for tool arguments (e.g., validating patch structure, `thing` format).
2.  **Add Comprehensive Tests:** Implement more thorough tests covering edge cases for all tools.
3.  **Update Memory Bank:** Reflect completion of robustness improvements.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The successful connection pattern involves passing `namespace`, `database`, and `auth` within the `connect` options.
*   The MCP server is TypeScript-based.
*   Credentials are sourced from environment variables.
*   Most SDK methods operating on specific records (`select`, `update`, `delete`, `merge`, `patch`, `upsert`) require a `RecordId` instance, not just the `table:id` string.
*   `insertRelation` requires the relation name and a data object containing `in` and `out` `RecordId`s.
*   Error logging now includes the full error object for better debugging.

## Future Considerations

*   **SDK Documentation:** Still relevant to consider opening a GitHub issue/PR for `surrealdb.js` SDK documentation regarding the `RecordId` requirement for specific record operations in methods like `select`, `update`, etc.
*   **More Advanced Tools:** Consider tools for transactions, schema management, or function execution if needed later.
