# Active Context: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 3 - Testing & Finalization)

## Current Focus

*   **Phase 3: Testing & Finalization.** Preparing the server for potential release by adding tests and ensuring the development setup is complete.

## Recent Changes

*   **Completed Phase 1 (Connection Verification).**
*   **Scaffolded MCP Server & Dependencies.**
*   **Implemented Basic Connection & Credential Refactoring.**
*   **Implemented Core Tools:** `query`, `select`, `create`, `update`, `delete` tools implemented and tested.
*   **Implemented Additional Tools:** `merge`, `patch`, `upsert`, `insert`, `insertRelation` tools implemented and tested.
*   **Improved Error Logging:** Updated `catch` blocks to log full error objects. Tested error reporting.
*   **Prepared for Publishing:**
    *   Updated `package.json` with metadata, `bin`, `files`, `engines`.
    *   Created `README.md` with installation/configuration instructions.
    *   Created `LICENSE` file (MIT).
    *   Created `llms-install.md` for automated installation.
    *   Added dev dependencies (`ts-node`, `eslint`, `prettier`, etc.).
    *   Added standard lint/format configs (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc.json`).
    *   Implemented `dev`, `lint`, `format` scripts in `package.json`.
*   **Input Validation Decision:** Decided against adding stricter regex validation for table/record IDs, relying instead on SurrealDB's own parsing and error handling, keeping only basic type/presence checks.
*   **Fixed Code Duplication:** Resolved duplicated code block near the end of `src/index.ts`.
*   **Updated ESLint Configuration:** Created `eslint.config.js` to use the new ESLint v9.0.0+ format, replacing the older `.eslintrc.cjs` approach.
*   **Fixed Linting Issues:** Removed unused imports and added appropriate ESLint disable comments for necessary `any` type usage.
*   **Verified Tool Functionality:** Manually tested all core tools (`query`, `create`, `select`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`) after code changes to ensure continued functionality.
*   **Updated Memory Bank:** `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` updated.

## Next Steps

1.  **Add Comprehensive Tests:** Implement automated tests covering all tools and edge cases (requires choosing a framework like Jest or Vitest).
2.  **Implement `test` script:** Update `package.json` to run the chosen test framework.
3.  **(Optional) Implement `dev` script fully:** Currently uses `ts-node`, could switch to `tsx` for potentially better performance/features if needed.
4.  **Final Review & Cleanup:** Review code, documentation, and configuration before considering release.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The server uses environment variables for configuration, making it flexible for different authentication methods (Root, NS, DB, Scope) depending on the credentials provided by the user.
*   Relying on SurrealDB for detailed input format validation (table/record IDs) rather than duplicating logic with potentially inaccurate regex in the server. Basic type/presence checks remain.
*   `RecordId` instances are necessary for most specific record operations with the SDK.
*   Error logging includes full error objects.
*   Project structure is set up for potential npm publishing.

## Future Considerations

*   **SDK Documentation:** Still relevant to consider opening a GitHub issue/PR for `surrealdb.js` SDK documentation regarding the `RecordId` requirement.
*   **More Advanced Tools:** Consider tools for transactions, schema management, or function execution if needed later.
*   **Testing Framework:** Need to choose and implement a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest).
