# Active Context: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 2 - Initial Tool Implementation)

## Current Focus

*   **Phase 2: Initial Tool Implementation & Testing.** The basic MCP server structure is in place, connects to the database, and has the first `query` tool implemented. Focus is now on building, configuring, and testing this initial version.

## Recent Changes

*   **Completed Phase 1 (Connection Verification).**
*   **Scaffolded MCP Server:** Successfully created the TypeScript MCP server structure in the current directory using `create-server` (via temp folder workaround).
*   **Installed Dependencies:** Installed core MCP/TypeScript dependencies and added `surrealdb`.
*   **Implemented Basic Connection:** Integrated the validated connection logic from `test-connection.js` into `src/index.ts`. The server now attempts to connect to SurrealDB on startup.
*   **Defined First Tool (`query`):** Implemented `ListTools` and `CallTool` handlers in `src/index.ts` for a basic `query` tool that accepts a `query_string`.

## Next Steps

1.  **Build:** Compile the TypeScript code using `npm run build`.
2.  **Configure:** Add/update the server entry in the MCP host settings (`cline_mcp_settings.json` or similar) so it can be run. This involves specifying the command (`node`), arguments (`build/index.js`), and potentially environment variables later.
3.  **Test Startup:** Run the server via the MCP host to verify it starts and successfully connects to the database.
4.  **Test Tool:** Use an MCP client (e.g., VS Code extension) to call the `query` tool with a simple, non-destructive query (e.g., `INFO FOR DB;`) and verify the response.
5.  **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the completion of the initial server structure and `query` tool.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The successful connection pattern involves passing `namespace`, `database`, and `auth` within the `connect` options. This will be the primary method used in the MCP server.
*   The MCP server is now TypeScript-based.
*   Credentials (`username`/`password`) are currently hardcoded in `src/index.ts` (marked with TODO) and need to be moved to environment variables managed by the MCP host settings for proper deployment.
