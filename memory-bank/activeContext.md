# Active Context: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 3 - Testing & Finalization)

## Current Focus

*   **Phase 3: Finalization & Publication.** The server has been published to GitHub and npm (currently at version 0.1.8). Focus is now on potential testing implementation and further improvements, including implementing schema inspection prompts.

## Recent Changes

*   **Completed Phase 1 (Connection Verification).**
*   **Scaffolded MCP Server & Dependencies.**
*   **Implemented Basic Connection & Credential Refactoring.**
*   **Implemented Core Tools:** `query`, `select`, `create`, `update`, `delete` tools implemented and tested.
*   **Implemented Additional Tools:** `merge`, `patch`, `upsert`, `insert`, `insertRelation` tools implemented and tested.
*   **Improved Error Logging:** Updated `catch` blocks to log full error objects. Tested error reporting.
*   **Prepared for Publishing:**
    *   Updated `package.json` with metadata, `bin`, `files`, `engines`.
    *   Created `README.md` with installation/configuration instructions.
    *   Created `LICENSE` file (MIT).
    *   Created `llms-install.md` for automated installation.
    *   Added dev dependencies (`ts-node`, `eslint`, `prettier`, etc.).
    *   Added standard lint/format configs (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc.json`).
    *   Implemented `dev`, `lint`, `format` scripts in `package.json`.
*   **Input Validation Decision:** Decided against adding stricter regex validation for table/record IDs, relying instead on SurrealDB's own parsing and error handling, keeping only basic type/presence checks.
*   **Fixed Code Duplication:** Resolved duplicated code block near the end of `src/index.ts`.
*   **Updated ESLint Configuration:** Created `eslint.config.js` to use the new ESLint v9.0.0+ format, replacing the older `.eslintrc.cjs` approach.
*   **Fixed Linting Issues:** Removed unused imports and added appropriate ESLint disable comments for necessary `any` type usage.
*   **Verified Tool Functionality:** Manually tested all core tools (`query`, `create`, `select`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`) after code changes to ensure continued functionality.
*   **Publication Preparation:**
    *   Published repository to GitHub at https://github.com/nsxdavid/surrealdb-mcp-server
    *   Updated `package.json` with correct repository information
    *   Created `.npmignore` file to control which files are published to npm
    *   Verified build process works correctly
*   **Publication:**
    *   Published to npm as versions 0.1.0 through 0.1.8
    *   Improved README with clearer installation and usage instructions
    *   Fixed JSON examples in README to remove comments
    *   Added support for additional AI assistants (Roo Code, Windsurf, Cursor)
    *   Added n8n integration documentation
*   **Additional Improvements:**
    *   Added support for the 'prompts' capability in v0.1.8
    *   Implemented handler for 'ListPromptsRequestSchema'
    *   Redirected logs to stderr for better debugging
    *   Added missing MCP protocol handlers
*   **Updated Memory Bank:** `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` updated.

## Next Steps

1.  **âœ… Create GitHub Releases:** GitHub releases have been created for versions v0.1.2, v0.1.3, v0.1.5, v0.1.6, and v0.1.8.
2.  **Implement Schema Inspection Prompts:** Enhance the server with prompts that provide database structure information:
    * **Phase 1 Prompts:**
      * `database_schema` - Provides complete database schema via `INFO FOR DB`
      * `table_schema` - Returns schema for a specific table via `INFO FOR TABLE <table>`
      * `list_tables` - Lists all tables in the database
    * **Implementation Approach:**
      * Enhance the `ListPromptsRequestSchema` handler to return the available prompts
      * Implement the `GetPromptRequestSchema` handler to generate prompt content
      * Execute appropriate SurrealQL queries and return raw results
      * Format results as context-rich messages for AI assistants
    * **Expected Benefits:**
      * Provides AI assistants with database structure information
      * Enables more accurate query generation and recommendations
      * Improves user experience by reducing the need for explicit tool calls
      * Follows industry patterns established by other database MCP servers
3.  **(Optional) Add Comprehensive Tests:** Implement automated tests covering all tools and edge cases (requires choosing a framework like Jest or Vitest).
4.  **(Optional) Implement `test` script:** Update `package.json` to run the chosen test framework.
5.  **(Optional) Update Documentation:** Ensure documentation reflects the latest changes, particularly the new 'prompts' capability added in v0.1.8 and the schema inspection prompts.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The server uses environment variables for configuration, making it flexible for different authentication methods (Root, NS, DB, Scope) depending on the credentials provided by the user.
*   Relying on SurrealDB for detailed input format validation (table/record IDs) rather than duplicating logic with potentially inaccurate regex in the server. Basic type/presence checks remain.
*   `RecordId` instances are necessary for most specific record operations with the SDK.
*   Error logging includes full error objects.
*   Project structure is set up for potential npm publishing.

## Future Considerations

*   **SDK Documentation:** Still relevant to consider opening a GitHub issue/PR for `surrealdb.js` SDK documentation regarding the `RecordId` requirement.
*   **More Advanced Tools:** Consider tools for transactions, schema management, or function execution if needed later.
*   **Testing Framework:** Need to choose and implement a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest).
*   **Expanded Prompts (Phase 2):** Consider implementing additional prompts for:
    * Query assistance (templates, explanations)
    * Database statistics
    * Graph relationship visualization
    * Data modeling suggestions
