# Progress: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 3 - Testing & Finalization)

## What Works

*   **Phase 1 Complete:** Successfully connected to the target SurrealDB instance (`ws://localhost:8000`, NS: `n8n`, DB: `AIWorld`) using root credentials via the `surrealdb` Node.js SDK (`test-connection.js`).
*   **MCP Server Scaffolding:** Created TypeScript project structure in the current directory.
*   **Dependencies:** Installed core MCP/TypeScript dependencies and `surrealdb`.
*   **Basic Connection:** Integrated connection logic into `src/index.ts`.
*   **First Tool (`query`):** Implemented the basic `query` tool in `src/index.ts`.
*   **Build:** Successfully compiled TypeScript to JavaScript (`npm run build`).
*   **Configuration:** Re-added server entry to MCP host settings (`cline_mcp_settings.json`).
*   **Startup Test:** Verified server starts and connects to DB when run via MCP host.
*   **Tool Test (`query`):** Successfully executed the `query` tool (`INFO FOR DB;`) via MCP client.
*   **Credential Refactoring:** Successfully updated `src/index.ts` to use environment variables (SURREALDB_URL, _NS, _DB, _USER, _PASS) provided by the MCP host configuration. Tested successfully.
*   **Second Tool (`select`):** Implemented the `select` tool in `src/index.ts`. Required using `new RecordId(table, idPart)` for `db.select()` when selecting a specific record, rather than just the `table:id` string. Tested successfully for both table-wide and specific ID selection.
*   **Third Tool (`create`):** Implemented the `create` tool in `src/index.ts` using `db.create()`. Tested successfully by creating a record in `mcp_test_data`.
*   **Fourth Tool (`update`):** Implemented the `update` tool in `src/index.ts`. Similar to `select`, required using `new RecordId(table, idPart)` for `db.update()` instead of the `table:id` string shown in documentation examples. Tested successfully by updating the test record.
*   **Fifth Tool (`delete`):** Implemented the `delete` tool in `src/index.ts`. Assumed and confirmed need for `new RecordId(table, idPart)` for `db.delete()`. Added handling for empty results when record not found. Tested successfully by deleting the test record and confirming non-existence.
*   **Sixth Tool (`merge`):** Implemented the `merge` tool in `src/index.ts` using `db.merge()`. Confirmed need for `RecordId`. Tested successfully.
*   **Seventh Tool (`patch`):** Implemented the `patch` tool in `src/index.ts` using `db.patch()`. Confirmed need for `RecordId`. Tested successfully with multiple patch operations.
*   **Eighth Tool (`upsert`):** Implemented the `upsert` tool in `src/index.ts` using `db.upsert()`. Confirmed need for `RecordId`. Tested successfully for both create and update scenarios.
*   **Ninth Tool (`insert`):** Implemented the `insert` tool in `src/index.ts` using `db.insert()`. Tested successfully for inserting multiple records.
*   **Tenth Tool (`insertRelation`):** Implemented the `insertRelation` tool in `src/index.ts` using `db.insertRelation()`. Corrected initial implementation based on documentation. Tested successfully.
*   **Improved Error Logging:** Updated `catch` blocks to log full error objects for better debugging.
*   **Project Publishing Preparation:**
    *   Updated `package.json` with metadata, `bin`, `files`, `engines` fields.
    *   Created comprehensive `README.md` with installation and configuration instructions.
    *   Added SurrealDB logo to README.
    *   Created `LICENSE` file (MIT).
    *   Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for contributors.
    *   Created `llms-install.md` for automated installation.
    *   Added dev dependencies and configuration files (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc.json`).
    *   Implemented `dev`, `lint`, `format` scripts in `package.json`.
*   **Code Quality Improvements:**
    *   Fixed code duplication in `src/index.ts`.
    *   Decided on input validation approach (relying on SurrealDB's validation).
    *   Updated ESLint configuration to use the new ESLint v9.0.0+ format (`eslint.config.js`).
    *   Fixed linting issues (removed unused imports, added appropriate ESLint disable comments).
    *   Ran formatter and linter to ensure code quality.
*   **Post-Change Testing:** Manually tested all core tools (`query`, `create`, `select`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`) after code changes to verify continued functionality.
*   **GitHub Publication:**
    *   Published repository to GitHub at https://github.com/nsxdavid/surrealdb-mcp-server
    *   Updated `package.json` with correct repository information (author, URLs)
*   **npm Publication:**
    *   Created `.npmignore` file to control which files are published to npm
    *   Verified build process works correctly
    *   Published to npm registry as versions 0.1.0, 0.1.1, and 0.1.2
    *   Improved README with clearer installation and usage instructions
    *   Fixed JSON examples in README to remove comments
    *   Added note clarifying that no manual installation is required when using npx
*   Memory Bank core files are initialized and being updated.

## What's Left to Build (Phase 3 - Finalization & Publication)

1.  **Create GitHub Release:** Create a release on GitHub with release notes for v0.1.2.
2.  **(Optional) Comprehensive Tests:** Implement automated tests covering all tools and edge cases.
3.  **(Optional) Test Script:** Add a `test` script to `package.json` once a testing framework is chosen.
4.  **(Optional) Improve Dev Script:** Consider switching from `ts-node` to `tsx` for potentially better performance.
5.  **(Optional) Implement More Tools:** Consider adding tools for other specific database operations if needed.

## Current Status

*   Phase 1 (Connection Verification) is complete.
*   Phase 2 (Robustness Improvements) is complete.
*   Phase 3 (Finalization & Publication): Project structure and documentation are complete. GitHub repository is published. Package is published to npm with improved documentation.
*   Server provides a comprehensive baseline of common SurrealDB operations and is well-documented for potential contributors.
*   Project is published and ready for use.

## Known Issues

*   Initial confusion regarding `signin` parameter names (`user`/`pass` vs. `username`/`password`) in the SDK vs. documentation/errors. Resolved by using `username`/`password` within the `connect` options `auth` object.
*   Initial confusion regarding the timing/necessity of `db.use()`. Resolved by providing NS/DB directly in `connect` options.
*   `db.select()`, `db.update()`, and `db.delete()` require a `RecordId` instance (not a string) when targeting a specific record ID, despite some documentation examples showing strings. Passing the `table:id` string resulted in unexpected behavior (`[]` return or incorrect results).
*   Handlers for `select` and `delete` need to check for empty/null results when a record is not found to avoid client-side validation errors.
