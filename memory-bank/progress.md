# Progress: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 1 Complete)

## What Works

*   **Phase 1 Complete:** Successfully connected to the target SurrealDB instance (`ws://localhost:8000`, NS: `n8n`, DB: `AIWorld`) using root credentials via the `surrealdb` Node.js SDK.
*   The successful connection pattern involves providing `namespace`, `database`, and `auth` options directly within the `db.connect()` method.
*   The `test-connection.js` script demonstrates this working connection.
*   Memory Bank core files are initialized.

## What's Left to Build (Phase 2 - MCP Server)

1.  Scaffold the MCP server project structure (TypeScript).
2.  Integrate the `surrealdb` SDK dependency.
3.  Implement the established connection logic within the server startup.
4.  Define and implement initial MCP tools (e.g., `query`).
5.  Configure the server for MCP host integration (environment variables for credentials).
6.  Test tool execution via MCP client.

## Current Status

*   Phase 1 (Connection Verification) is complete.
*   Ready to begin Phase 2 (MCP Server Scaffolding).

## Known Issues

*   Initial confusion regarding `signin` parameter names (`user`/`pass` vs. `username`/`password`) in the SDK vs. documentation/errors. Resolved by using `username`/`password` within the `connect` options `auth` object.
*   Initial confusion regarding the timing/necessity of `db.use()`. Resolved by providing NS/DB directly in `connect` options.
