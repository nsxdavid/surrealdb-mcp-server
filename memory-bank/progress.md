# Progress: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 2 - Initial Tool Tested)

## What Works

*   **Phase 1 Complete:** Successfully connected to the target SurrealDB instance (`ws://localhost:8000`, NS: `n8n`, DB: `AIWorld`) using root credentials via the `surrealdb` Node.js SDK (`test-connection.js`).
*   **MCP Server Scaffolding:** Created TypeScript project structure in the current directory.
*   **Dependencies:** Installed core MCP/TypeScript dependencies and `surrealdb`.
*   **Basic Connection:** Integrated connection logic into `src/index.ts`.
*   **First Tool (`query`):** Implemented the basic `query` tool in `src/index.ts`.
*   **Build:** Successfully compiled TypeScript to JavaScript (`npm run build`).
*   **Configuration:** Re-added server entry to MCP host settings (`cline_mcp_settings.json`).
*   **Startup Test:** Verified server starts and connects to DB when run via MCP host.
*   **Tool Test (`query`):** Successfully executed the `query` tool (`INFO FOR DB;`) via MCP client.
*   **Credential Refactoring:** Successfully updated `src/index.ts` to use environment variables (SURREALDB_URL, _NS, _DB, _USER, _PASS) provided by the MCP host configuration. Tested successfully.
*   **Second Tool (`select`):** Implemented the `select` tool in `src/index.ts`. Required using `new RecordId(table, idPart)` for `db.select()` when selecting a specific record, rather than just the `table:id` string. Tested successfully for both table-wide and specific ID selection.
*   Memory Bank core files are initialized and being updated.

## What's Left to Build (Phase 2 - MCP Server)

1.  **Implement More Tools:** Add tools for other common DB operations (create, update, delete).
2.  **Error Handling/Robustness:** Improve error handling and add more comprehensive logging.
3.  **Testing:** Add more thorough tests for tools.

## Current Status

*   Phase 1 (Connection Verification) is complete.
*   Phase 2: `query` and `select` tools are implemented and tested. Credential refactoring complete.
*   Ready for next steps: Implementing `create`, `update`, or `delete` tools.

## Known Issues

*   Initial confusion regarding `signin` parameter names (`user`/`pass` vs. `username`/`password`) in the SDK vs. documentation/errors. Resolved by using `username`/`password` within the `connect` options `auth` object.
*   Initial confusion regarding the timing/necessity of `db.use()`. Resolved by providing NS/DB directly in `connect` options.
*   `db.select()` requires a `RecordId` instance (not a string) when selecting a specific record ID. Passing the `table:id` string resulted in an empty array `[]`.
