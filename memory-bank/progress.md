# Progress: SurrealDB MCP Server (Phase 2 - Initial Build Complete)

## What Works

*   **Phase 1 Complete:** Successfully connected to the target SurrealDB instance (`ws://localhost:8000`, NS: `n8n`, DB: `AIWorld`) using root credentials via the `surrealdb` Node.js SDK (`test-connection.js`).
*   **MCP Server Scaffolding:** Created TypeScript project structure in the current directory.
*   **Dependencies:** Installed core MCP/TypeScript dependencies and `surrealdb`.
*   **Basic Connection:** Integrated connection logic into `src/index.ts`; server attempts connection on startup.
*   **First Tool (`query`):** Implemented the basic `query` tool in `src/index.ts`.
*   **Build:** Successfully compiled TypeScript to JavaScript (`npm run build`).
*   Memory Bank core files are initialized and being updated.

## What's Left to Build (Phase 2 - MCP Server)

1.  **Configure:** Verify/update the server entry in MCP host settings (`cline_mcp_settings.json`). (Appears correct based on last read).
2.  **Test Startup:** Run the server via the MCP host to verify successful startup and database connection.
3.  **Test Tool:** Use an MCP client to call the `query` tool with a simple, non-destructive query (e.g., `INFO FOR DB;`) and verify the response.
4.  **Refactor Credentials:** Move hardcoded DB credentials from `src/index.ts` to environment variables managed by MCP host settings.
5.  **Implement More Tools:** Add tools for other common DB operations (select, create, update, delete).

## Current Status

*   Phase 1 (Connection Verification) is complete.
*   Phase 2: Initial server structure, connection logic, and `query` tool are implemented and built.
*   Ready to test server startup and the `query` tool via MCP host.

## Known Issues

*   Initial confusion regarding `signin` parameter names (`user`/`pass` vs. `username`/`password`) in the SDK vs. documentation/errors. Resolved by using `username`/`password` within the `connect` options `auth` object.
*   Initial confusion regarding the timing/necessity of `db.use()`. Resolved by providing NS/DB directly in `connect` options.
